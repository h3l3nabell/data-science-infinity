The Project section is great. In fact I would promote this section right to the top, after your profile summary (which I also like - assuming you'll tailor this a little for each job application - e.g. only mention your interest in finance when applying for finance jobs), especially while you're looking for your first software job.  This section is excellent and shows that you are getting hands on experience under your own steam, shows your enthusiasm and it should guide interview conversations so that you can talk about these projects to demonstrate your competencies.  I would put the Project section right at the top under Profile. However, for each project I would suggest starting with a one-sentence description of the purpose of the software, to give the reader context.  Then, get into the detail of the tech stack used. So, for example, with your Community Cupboard project, I would swap around the order a bit like this.  ""The idea behind this project is to connect food banks to those who are physically unable to access these services. This is an original passion project that has been in the works for quite a while. Currently  heading a team of five people to complete a full stack application using react.js, JavaScript, express.js and mongodb atlas.""   Then, I would swap your Education and Employment history sections around, so that things that are relevant to software that you have under Employment History are on the first page.  Your Employment history has more software-relevant content in it.  With the education section, you don't really need to go into the detail of your grades for anything except for the latest one, I would keep it in for the BSc degree, but I wouldn't bother with the grades for the BTEC or anything beyond that.   I would use the additional space to go into a bit more detail on a current software project, such as describing how you're using github for your team project source control, and maybe if you're running agile sprints or doing pair programming.   You can add your grade details into Linkedin if you want, if someone is interested in you they will head straight there after reading your CV.  I think your CV is pretty good, but for me, the measure of a good CV is whether you're invited to interviews.  If you are, then your CV is doing its job.  The second thing the CV should do, is guide the interview general questions in a direction you like to talk about, where you can show your enthusiasm and give the interviewer a little insight into what it would be like to work with you. I think your project section is the ideal place to do this. I hope this helps.¬†  Did you get any feedback from your recent interviews?¬†¬†  Kind Regards Helen",INBOX

As I suspected it is pretty good for a graduate CV.  My suggestions for improving it and making it stand out would be to add in a bit more information on what you actually built with the technologies you learned, and a little bit about how you were working.¬†  I would add this definitely in each of the Employment History entries for the software roles.   At present it reads a bit as though you were just learning technologies; could you start each section with details of the applications you created, what domain problems they aimed to solve, and, if you were working as part of a team, how did you organise yourselves and what challenges did you address, both technical and interpersonal?  For the profile section, I would consider having a couple of different profiles for different types of job application.    For example, are you planning to target medical tech companies?  In which case definitely have one profile that talks about how you'd love to use your domain knowledge combined with your technical knowledge. Also have a more general one for other applications, that maybe talks about how you feel that your attention to detail, team skills and fascination with learning new technologies would help you make a difference to their products.  The profile is the first part that people will read, and sometimes they'll make a snap decision whether to read on, so concentrate on making it intriguing and interesting.  Try to read it from an employer's point of view - its job is to capture their interest and make them want to talk to you.  All the best Helen",INBOX

Do you mind if I make a small suggestion about your LinkedIn profile?  Think of the one-line title below your name as your 'Headline', a bit like the one-liner on a youtube video cover that makes you decide to watch it! - you want something like clickbait - but honest clickbait!  Instead of 'graduate looking for junior software developer positions' try something like ""Enthusiastic and capable junior developer with healthcare diagnostics domain expertise and a strong head for mathematics""  Then, maybe, re-think your Linked In About section as more of a short letter to your ideal future employer, and less of a Bio about you.  The purpose of this section is to build up curiosity in your potential employers, to make them want to read on; to make them want to talk to you.  Tell them about your enthusiasm for coding, and your particular interests.    Tell them about your domain knowledge from your studies and the soft skills you could bring with you from your previous experiences.  Anything about communication, problem solving and teamwork is good.   Tell them how you'd love to use your unique combination of skills. enthusiasm and experience to help them with their business.  Basically, make it as much as possible about how you can help them, and how enjoyable it would be to work with you.  Read over it from that point of view, and see how you could improve it.  Move the details of your qualifications, what technologies you studied and which bootcamps you attended, down to the education and experience sections, and flesh them out there.  They'll be more useful once you've first got someone's attention.   I wish you all the best in your job hunt!  Kind Regards Helen",INBOX

Our team of five had to pull together to create a culminating project. While I juggled a tight schedule, I took on the dual challenge of leading front-end development and integrating OpenAI, an unfamiliar technology.   Action:   Knowing I couldn't let my team down, I embraced a ""learn-as-you-go"" mentality. My afternoons were dedicated to deciphering the OpenAI documentation and mastering TailwindCSS, the framework we were using. Sleep was sacrificed, but the goal of a successful project fueled my determination.   Result:   Despite the time crunch, I not only grasped the concepts but excelled in their implementation. The integration with OpenAI added a layer of intelligence and interactivity that made our project stand out. Our basic prototype morphed into a sleek, data-driven web application that exceeded expectations.   Impact:   Our final presentation was a moment of truth. Standing before 14 industry experts, we showcased our creation with nervous excitement and pride. Their feedback was glowing, commending our technical skills, innovative approach, and seamless use of OpenAI. We had not only completed the project but exceeded expectations.   Lesson Learned:   This experience wasn't just about technical skills; it was about resilience and resourcefulness. I learned that diving into the documentation, no matter how challenging, is the best first step. The knowledge gained is empowering, allowing you to conquer obstacles regardless of time constraints or unfamiliarity.   Moving Forward:   I carry this lesson forward into my professional journey. When faced with new technologies or challenges, I approach them with an open mind and a thirst for knowledge. Documentation becomes my guide, unlocking my potential and allowing me to contribute meaningfully. Who knows, maybe one day I'll be on the other side of the panel, inspiring the next generation of coders with my own story.",INBOX

Thank you for being patient! As promised I have taken a look at your CV, and I didn't want to rush the feedback.   First, I love the layout and design of your CV.  It looks very clean and professional.  If you are also applying for jobs based on your Military experience, then I would suggest having two CV's.  This one for military related applications, and a second one focussed on AI.  Having two separate CV's would allow you to write a more focussed profile section tailored to each type of role, rather than trying to hit both audiences with the same paragraph.   On the one hand you're an experienced leader, able to work under pressure and take difficult decisions, and on the other hand you're a qualified data science engineer with all the technical problem solving skills that involves.  I would say, that you need to allow the AI one to move onto two pages, because if you're using it to try to get AI-related jobs, you need to include much more detail about projects you have done in that field.  Your work experience is good in that it shows that you are able to take responsibility, but, it isn't really helping you show off your AI skills.   For that, I think you need to expand on the Projects section of your CV to include more details about your Masters degree projects, like the approach you took, the skills and techniques you used in that project, what you found out. Also, I would suggest move this section up and put it above your Work Experience section.    If you have any other data science projects in your portfolio, maybe from earlier student days, or things you've done since graduating, that would also be good to add to your Projects section.    All the best in your job hunting.  Kind Regards Helen",INBOX

I definitely had the edge there compared to many others who come from a Non-CS background.  In my opinion Data Engineering is the best experience to have before diving into data science because you get to really understand how the pipeline is working, where and how you are grabbing the data. There are so many sources (Kafka, splunk, datadog, AWS S3) etc. You think in terms of optimisation. Once the data engineer is done doing this work a data analyst merely takes this massaged data to make a good visualisation out of it.  On the other hand Data Sciemce is a blend of both but also includes a lot more of statistics. The Data Scientist I work with who come from a Non-coding background, from what I have noticed is they are really bad coders but great statisticans.  ",INBOX

I cannot get hold of recruiters (always on another call, never ring back, multiple messages) and out of all the emails/linkedin messages I've sent only one has ever responded. There's just no suitable roles either, any that do come up have the most incredible requirements that you can never quite meet, applying anyway is just met with silence. I've tapped up pretty much everyone I have ever worked with and there is just nothing. My best advice is if Shire offer a renewal definitely take it! And if they need others I will 100% come back!  I've started planning for my book, and actually got a really good idea how to modernize my original draft of it, but in terms of writing yet no... I appreciate your enthusiasm and recommendations for it! And actually I'm getting really excited about modernizing it, but I've been trying to train and add more strings to my bow just to try and meet some of these job requirements - graphql is pretty cool if you haven't checked that out!

I have a Cat6 ethernet link wired to every room, and a Virgin media cable link with a Hub3 thing for internet located inside the front door - the expensive Virgin Media package which  promises 200Mb internet speed (which it does on the ethernet link) but wifi is ok at front of the house, but gets weak on the top floor and non existant at the back of the house.  I have a wifi booster to try and solve that which manages to boost the wifi signal to just about visible at the back of the house, but the signal strength is poor, and it is basically boosting the wifi system over the airwaves.  So, given that I have ethernet in every room that gives pretty good internet connection over the wire, is there a thing that I can buy and plug into that ethernet at the back of the house that would create a good wifi signal there?   If so, what would that thing be called? and how hard would it be for a non-hardware-literate person to set up? ;)",INBOX

Concentrica is a team of highly experienced sales and marketing professionals, ultimately focused upon the generation of both Sales Ready and Market Ready Leads. Our clients are all drawn exclusively from the IT Solutions and Services sectors.  Our key differentiators include the facts that all campaigns have hands on involvement from at least one Concentrica director and that we never use inexperienced graduates. These considerations are vital where the requirement inevitably exists to minimise the lead time to effective campaign initiation and delivery.    We work effectively with a wide variety of clients, ranging from importantly the start-up venture, through to enduring relationships with strategic business partners from blue chip companies, which include Microsoft, CA Technologies and SAP.  Our approach which our long term clients particularly value, provides a seamless extension to their sales force, delivering all the successful elements of Business Development through a 'Virtual Sales' essence in deployment.

Requirements: - be ready to run a tech company as CEO, focusing on marketing and sales - has a will and time to jump in a new venture investing at least their own time and network - knows the market of online education, its pain points, and needs - has experience in online marketing and sales  What we have: - Working MVP with investments around $20K - Customer development, marketing research completed - Team of developers and office in Kyiv, Ukraine  What we offer: - Share 10-75% depending on efforts and investments (we are not incorporated yet) - Being one of the initial co-founders having the related level of authority and responsibilities",INBOX

However, the great news is that home renovations and construction is allowed to continue and all existing and new businesses will be closely following the guidelines on working safely in other people‚Äôs homes (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/homes)   Refresh is the world‚Äôs largest design and build residential renovation company and each franchise is highly scalable.

There is very strong consumer demand for our more professional offer, which is why even through COVID-19 and lockdowns, demand is high.

Azure resources are becoming more sought after as businesses are putting more commitment into the WFH set up and delivering projects remotely.   With this said, the solution to this being IT contractors can be one that many businesses are yet to try.   Since the start of 2020, including January and February, we received our highest project request last month in comparison to any other month so things are moving forwards despite Covid-19 and hopefully will continue to do so.   For this reason, I am writing to you to introduce myself and Nigel Frank International as a leading provider in the Midlands of the UK for top-tier IT Talent. I am confident that I can provide you any solution to fit your business needs during this time, being based in Lincolnshire myself.  I want to align any activities properly, to avoid unnecessary contact or ""CV pushing"" from my side, so please do come back to me with any needs if in the immediate term, or a time when we could take a 10/15 minute phonecall to discuss if there is a need or not.   I look forwards to hearing from you.   Kind regards, Jack Burgess  Jack Gregory Burgess Azure and .Net Recruitment (contract) | International Business Management ",INBOX

For me it's about hiring the right people, and giving them plenty of autonomy and trust. Poor comunicators, 9-5 ers won't work out for me. Remote work is a benefit for the employee, so it's fair to ask for a little more from them.  Comms are worse when it comes to small questions, just grabbing someone etc. But if you have a culture where people are always on slack for a quick call life becomes easier - devs will appreciate greater asynchronous communication / less dustractions, and text conversations are handy to refer back to for clarity on what was agreed.",INBOX

I can give you an example of a small software company where everybody used to be in the office and would work on a piece of a project for several weeks and didn't bring it together with others on a regular basis ie daily or certainly weekly. they have really struggled as people working from home did not communicate with others and spent a lot of time developing software that was wrong.

I think one thing we did reasonably well on was ensuring everyone had the right working environment from home.  So ensuring everyone has a chair, desk, equipment and also talking through what people wanted to use. So staff could choose between using their own kit (with funded upgrades), which means you don't have to have a work PC and a home PC or using kit issued by the company. And we moved everything we could to the cloud so no one has a server sitting in their house, which we did have in our old office.  I think also communicating well, letting people take advantage of the freedom home working gives and being trusted to do it without being monitored, plus understanding that everyone's motivation is in phases and letting people know to turn off at the end of the working day.  Loads of video calls, but making sure they don't last too long. Inviting greater numbers of staff to talk to clients in video calls helps with communication and involvement,  whereas in the past it might have just been a couple of us in that client conversation.  If Liverpool wasn't in Tier 3 we'd be meeting physically periodically.   There's a lot of other things we want to do as well, feel free to send me any ideas via linkedin you might garner from other companies.¬†  Cheers  John",INBOX

Sure but please don't use my name in any article. It's very unique and I try, very hard, to keep out of the search engines üòÖ Suddenly working from home as a developer can be brilliant but also frustrating. At the end of the day we all want to deliver when product and program management need. If I have gone from two monitors to one, if accessing the continuous integration system is slow because of a poor VPN, if I can't easily share files with other developers (attachment blocked), if I don't have access to test hardware (firmware developers and QA), then it's going to be frustrating and demoralising. First thing I looked at was making sure everyone had the best setup we could manage to provide and that we ironed out communications issues. During lockdown when the schools were closed and kids were at home it was very easy to get detailed. Just like trying to develop in an open plan space when random people come and ask you a question and poof you just lost half an hour of thought. Some developers made 'on air' signs to let the kids, and partner to know not to disturb them. So, right tools, good comms, and mitigations to disruption. Then it's just a case of keeping regular contact, having the remote team members get together and demo what they just did, encouraging them to still work together and share each others ideas and thinking to problems. No one should feel isolated and overwhelmed but you need to check-in with people.",INBOX

It's worth looking at our new normal as an opportunity.  Here's what I've found works.  Firstly, maintain structure around things like standups, Agile ceremonies, refinement activities and similar.  Helping the team structure these activities improves coordination and communication.  Secondly, make time for personal development, 1-to-1s, and other engagement activities.  We have a regular Teams call where everyone talks a little bit about what's going on in their life.  It helps maintain that sense of community.  Finally, understand well-being and the different ways people are reacting to remote working.  Some people enjoy getting more time with family.  Others crave being in an office environment.  Making adjustments to help individuals adapt to their circumstances will help them stay healthy and productive.  Cheers, Rob",INBOX

There is no doubt that core factors are still central. So people doing important things are motivated by their sense of purpose whether remote or colocated.  Having said that, for many organisations the forced move to remote working has given a real sense of pride and achievement to those people that made it happen - especially in more traditional organisations where it was unexpected.   I know some people, particularly hands on developers I used to work with have really enjoyed being flexible with their time. For example, being able to kick off processes throughout the day whilst doing other things.   For those I am working with now, continuing to get things out on time, to budget and at agreed quality levels is clearly motivating. They are typically people working for third parties and are very geared up around doing this despite obstacles.   I don't anyone who had been demotivated by having to be online so much but plenty who have found it tiring - especially those who Scrum Masters or managers who are spending a lot of time in online meetings. They are still motivated to get the job done but it is taking more out of them.  I look forward to reading more on this later   Best   David  ",INBOX

Another has gotten rid of the second car in the household.   We have compensated for the lack of togetherness by the extensive use of Microsoft teams. Cameras are on in some meetings but not all. Meetings for us always had a bit of banter and this has not changed since we moved virtual.   I do however worry about group dynamic and feelings of belonging in a team. I have had a few training days to help compensate. When things get a little better I do plan to have team days in the office and possibly something outside hours to help.   One thing we are starting to help younger members of the team is a more formal mentoring system between senior members of the team and junior members to encourage more question asking and better learning. Between myself and my team lead we do try and make sure we touch base with everyone at least a couple of days a week. This has taken a wee bit of intentionality that we didn‚Äôt need before.   My conclusion is on the whole this is a lot more natural for software developers to work this way. The overhead of a commute office rules and social interaction that office based working adds makes our job harder not better. We just need to find new ways to fill in what is now lacking.   Thanks  Mark. ,INBOX

It's interesting some of the feedback so far suggests that a lot of teams are appreciating the flexibility, and reclaiming their commute time, and have found their teams have generally increased productivity.    But others have mentioned that keeping communication flowing has been important, they now need to be more pro-active in checking in with team members, as they can't rely on organically spotting issues they would have done in the office.  Most people are turning cameras on for remote calls/meetings, as an encouraged option rather than a forced policy.  Some people are encouraging a period of informal chat at the beginning of meetings, to try and foster a bit of camaraderie and banter that would normally be happening in the office.  One manager is using Mob Programming a lot in his team now, (a bit like pair programming, but with groups of 3 or 4 working together on code on a video call and taking 20 minute turns to code) and finding this is great for keeping the team spirit together as well as benefits to knowledge sharing for staff, especially juniors, and real time code reviews.

I've worked from home before for a couple of years, and found no issues with it, there was maybe a bit of cabin fever at the time, but making myself get out the house regularly helped - gym at lunchtime, and having a season ticket for my local rugby team esnured I was getting out and socialising every few weeks.    The different environments people live in do have a massive effect, I had one team member living in a student studio flat, which was tiny, he was from overseas too, so did find the isolation, and being stuck in the one room hard going at times.  I've also spoken to people who are either sitting on their couch working (not ideal) or working on a dressing table, again not ideal.  I do think that as more companies realise that working from home is a productive and efficient way to work, there will be different demands on the types of property people buy, and also the location - there is less need to be in commutable distance to the office.  I'm sure there will be an evolving market in ""work from home furniture"".    Software development is, on the whole a solitary business, so there are reduced distractions at home, which enables the guys to sink into their work, and solve problems.  As easy as it is to work longer hours, I always encourage staff to ensure they take breaks, get out for some exercise, give the mind a rest - which can also be the best time to solve problems.    Camera's for meetings are useful, it does help with the social/informal chat in a meeting, even if its just noticing that someone's had a hair cut, or as sometimes happened with m during lock-down, my daughter would join in the meeting!  You can also see when people are paying attention or not too I really like the idea of Mob Programming, as you are saying there so many benefits to it, both professionally, and socially. Kind regards Iain",INBOX

Honestly, I think the answers from my experience aren't significantly different from my answers for co-located teams. Superficially, making sure teams have the right levels of equipment, have a comfortable working environment etc are all just as important, if not more so, for remote teams. Communication is critical, making sure people get the right amount of contact with people, not only for doing their job but so they don't feel isolated. I think cameras on for remote calls help with that a lot, albeit not everyone feels comfortable with that, so ultimately user's choice with that. Last point would be about trying to ensure your team is able to operate asynchronously where possible. If people have to wait for colleagues to perform tasks before they can complete their current task, you can end up with blockers. So supporting people to do parallel tasks is useful. As is helping people understand the priority of any blocking task against whatever they're currently doing. Code reviews would be a good example of that for a software specific example. Nobody likes waiting 3 days for a pull request if that's how you work, or having nobody to pair with if that's your preference.  That's off the top of my head. I don't think any of it is specifically tech focused though, I think that would apply to any environment.  Hope that's in some way useful. I'd love to read your piece once done.  Regards  Dave",INBOX

Poor communication and feedback seems to be the biggest demotivator - if one person on the team doesn't communicate well, it causes more of a problem when its remote, as I think the group doesn't automatically repair the problem by talking to them proactively, or working to setup some group meetings.

In fact, we have noticed a surge in new vacancies across the IT sector and technology in particular appears to be proving resilient to broader employment impacts in the UK.  One of our newest clients came to us after struggling throughout 2019 to recruit. They generally received hundreds of applications, but less than 4% of those applicants were actually qualified and this had a devastating effect on their retention, as well as their reputation!  By revamping their employer image and recruiting strategy, I helped them boost the quality of their recruiting pool by 30% in eight weeks.  If you‚Äôre interested in learning how a new recruiting strategy can benefit your business, even if hiring staff is a priority right now, please send me your best availability and number to reach you.

I hope you‚Äôre keeping well and learning to work in the new COVID-era.  We‚Äôve sat down (remotely) with several of our clients and partners to discuss and share their views on the changing workplace landscape and how it‚Äôs affecting the way we hire new talent.  The questions we had most, are: ‚ÄúWhat now? What next? Where do we go from here? The will to move forward is there, but how!‚Äù  We are starting to see green shoots in the tech community and increased focus not on the employed and passive candidates that, pre-COVID, were looking to facilitate a move, but instead on the fantastic candidates that have hit the market due to the extreme circumstances.  - Video is now the interview process. Used well, with a proven telephone screening, more structure and creatively, with one-way interviews, group interviews, and candidate presentations - it significantly cuts down the hiring process. - Augmented with online assessments (personality and technical) you discover an in-depth view of their person skills as well as attitude and aptitude, which makes up for what you lose by not being face-to-face. - Interviews can be arranged, ‚Äòhassle-free‚Äô and with no travel, and with more WFH opportunities, geography is less of a barrier to finding the best candidates (and reducing the amount of ‚Äòno-shows‚Äô)  I'd be happy to share with you the highlights of those talks and attach our latest article ‚ÄúTop 5 Tips for Recruiting in 2020‚Äù - www.linkedin.com/posts/aamerayoob_5-tips-for-recruiting-in-2020-activity-6702475648071434240-kohQ  Feel free to chat through any other challenges you may be experiencing and I‚Äôll give you any advice you might need.

I think you need ¬†WIFI Access Points in a few places, depending how direct in the vertical and horizontal plane your access point is. WIFI will travel through plaster and brick ¬†to some degree in the horizontal and vertical plane but the problem comes when you try to access a WIFI point at an angle through the house as the direct beam might have to travel through twice of three times the thickness of wall as it is going through at an angle.  There are a few options but I've not tried them as I use Google hubs which communicate via radio in a Mesh network but as you have CAT6 cable it's better to use this.  I think you might be able to use the Google routers as WAPs as they each have an ethernet port. There is a really cheap device that I have used that seems to have WAP mode - see TPLInk - very cheap -¬†https://www.tp-link.com/uk/home-networking/3g-usb-adapter/tl-wr802n/  I think you would need to have a multi point standard router as your hub and then use the CAT6 to fan out from each port to multiple of these WIFI Apps.  These are quite cheap so not sure of how reliable or performant they are but I'm sure there are other similar devices on the market at a higher price point.  Steve",INBOX

I have a Cat6 ethernet link wired to every room, and a Virgin media cable link with a Hub3 thing for internet located inside the front door - the expensive Virgin Media package which  promises 200Mb internet speed (which it does on the ethernet link) but wifi is ok at front of the house, but gets weak on the top floor and non existant at the back of the house.  I have a wifi booster to try and solve that which manages to boost the wifi signal to just about visible at the back of the house, but the signal strength is poor, and it is basically boosting the wifi system over the airwaves.  So, given that I have ethernet in every room that gives pretty good internet connection over the wire, is there a thing that I can buy and plug into that ethernet at the back of the house that would create a good wifi signal there?   If so, what would that thing be called? and how hard would it be for a non-hardware-literate person to set up? ;)",INBOX

You could say they are a start-up BUT within a much bigger organization who have been around for over 100  years and have financial backing an industry which is vital during times like this.   Using the latest tech (all work remote work and onboarding for the time being but their offices once this is over is across the road from Birmingham Central Station) with flexible working anyway.    Roles we need to fill for them ASAP;  *Tech Lead's *2 Full Stack Developers (.NET, C#, Windows OS) *Senior Business Analyst (Agile, Software Applications)  *Senior QA/Tester   Full spec attached for one role but please don't focus too much on the spec as they have a few positions here :) I also have much more information I can send you if you want to see more about the company or the culture etc including my own notes from the CTO whom I placed previously.

Sounds very much like my house. So The fact that you have cat6 everywhere is excellent and all you basically need is a WiFi router  plugged in. You can get these cheap, basically netgear or the like will work however if you want something smart that means you have a single WiFi name for each ap and your device seamlessly moves between them I can recommend unifi kit. Not cheap by any means but works well as all the access points pretend to be the same WiFi rather than 3 seperate ones. Although having cheap seperate device with three different name ie frontroom, upstairs and kitchen works OK. All this stuff is pretty much plug and play and the unifi kit is app driven with good instructions, but I recon you do either setup. ",INBOX

I have a Cat6 ethernet link wired to every room, and a Virgin media cable link with a Hub3 thing for internet located inside the front door - the expensive Virgin Media package which  promises 200Mb internet speed (which it does on the ethernet link) but wifi is ok at front of the house, but gets weak on the top floor and non existant at the back of the house.  I have a wifi booster to try and solve that which manages to boost the wifi signal to just about visible at the back of the house, but the signal strength is poor, and it is basically boosting the wifi system over the airwaves.  So, given that I have ethernet in every room that gives pretty good internet connection over the wire, is there a thing that I can buy and plug into that ethernet at the back of the house that would create a good wifi signal there?   If so, what would that thing be called? and how hard would it be for a non-hardware-literate person to set up? ;)",INBOX

As I said in my intro, I'm one of the founders of nextfree.co.uk - a service that helps freelance Contractors & Consultants share their availability for new work.  Would you be interested in joining us?  It's free to sign up, takes less than two minutes to complete your profile and then less than 30 seconds a time to update your availability.  You get a public NEXTFREE profile which you can share with clients / recruiters so that they can see and track your availability (without them having to sign up), and you'll appear in our search results when paid up Recruiters (in-house and at agencies) are looking for someone with your skillset, location and availability.  You can also push your availability to LinkedIn and Twitter each time you change it, and we're looking to make it easy to share updates more widely in the future.  If it sounds like something you'd like to try, sign up for an invite at: https://www.nextfree.co.uk/freelancers_landing and I'll get you one sent out ASAP.  If you have any questions about what we're doing and how it works, let me know.  Thanks again,  James  PS - I just wanted to add: I'm not a Recruiter. I'm an ex-UX Consultant, now Product Manager, who grew frustrated with having the same conversation about my availability for work over and over and over again with Recruiters and Clients.

Details of the Recommendation:  ""Until recently Helen and I had been working on the Conferences 2012 Project at St. James‚Äôs Place.     Helen and I were a good team and I enjoyed working with her. Helen delivered high quality code and on time, would stay late to meet deadlines and ensure that she gave me a release daily. Much of the time we were under pressure and she remained totally calm and unflustered! The Project had a somewhat ‚Äòiterative‚Äô approach, and as not all of the detail was spec‚Äôd Helen played a big part in the design, producing web pages that were neat, user friendly and intuitive, and any updates to the database were accurate and well thought through. She was sensitive to my workload and always checked with me whether it was convenient before releasing code. I felt that Helen appreciated my work, she welcomed any defects (unlike some developers I have worked with!), and always took the time to ensure that she understood the issue and could recreate it. Her release notes were clear and concise so I knew exactly what my testing would involve for each drop of code.    We have now gone our separate ways and Helen is off to India to do some Microsoft training. I would like to wish her the best of luck and hope that I get the opportunity to work with her again one day. If you are looking for an A* developer snap her up when she gets back!""  ",INBOX

I was torn between the staying and going but we did need to make some headway up country in Vera. Keith isn't that great in social situations as well. He doesn't like them really although he will tolerate them for my sake without getting sulky about it. He is a lot more considerate and generous than most of my previous partners.    We are trying to find a way to start dancing again. Trouble is he has just gone and broken his arm. We found out he needs an operation to set it as the bone setting hasn't worked. He needs full mobility for his job. We are still waiting for the NHS to give him a slot. Unfortunately it will mean an op at Gloucester Royal. Very local to us is some French dancing. I think it may be a bit like Cajun. So a bit folky. Cajun has very many moves that are exactly like Ceroc but to the Cajun stepping... which makes your knees ache! Trust the French.

Both Iain and I felt you had some good management experience which is what the team needs togehter with your technical skills.  Something I do not have to the depth of your technical ability.      You interviewed vey well and came across as a strong candidate.  Iain and I both feel that the team needs some stability as they have been without a direct manager for almost twelve months.  We had an internal candidate who was appointed, but unfortunately was head hunted after only a month or two in the role.  We now need the stability to provide direction and focus the team and felt that a nine month contract would not provide the solution we are looking for.    I have spoken to Nabeel and agreed that we would certainly keep you in mind if we needed someone on a short to medium term project.

I appreciated the positive feedback I received from Nabeel Haq, and I'm sorry to turn down the opportunity to take up a permanent position with you.  I would have loved to work with you for a fixed period of 9 months, and felt I could contribute a great deal to the team, as well as being able to plan a controlled handover to a successor, or mentor someone existing who may be able to grow into the role.     However, I do not feel it would be right for me to take a permanent position at this time, knowing that I would want to take 3 months off next winter, and probably each year for the foreseeable future.  The only fair solution for my employers and myself that I can see is to stick with my decision to work on a contracting basis.     I have decided to balance my life by spending 2-3 months per year in the Alps teaching snowboarding,  every year while I'm fit enough to do it.  I have been training towards this for the last 2 years, initially via a sabbatical from my previous job.  I find doing this not only keeps me physically fit and healthy, it makes such a refreshing change after 9 months of intensive work in software development, and I come back to work feeling re-invigorated and enthused to take up the mental challenges again with renewed energy.      I appreciate that if you have found a suitable candidate who can take the position permanently; this may be a better solution for you.  However if you find that you are having difficulty retaining staff at the right level, or if at some point in the future you have a need for additional resource between the months of April and December, I would be very glad to hear from you.

Not only does it cost more for hosting on Windows Servers than with Linux but many of the cloud tools and services are being built for open source platforms.    What do you think? Is .NET getting the attention it deserves in the cloud? Should people even consider it as a viable option for creating cloud computing apps?

Yes it was redundancy, sort of by mutual agreement... they're merging the development teams across Tony's world of Parking/Police & Public Protection under one manager.  I didn't fancy spending my life driving between Bath, Luton and Chesterfield though so decided to take redundancy instead of going through the normal shenanigans with two of us applying for the new job.  I've known for a while but it's taken ages to get the message out and ended up being 3 days before I left!    It was all a bit of a shock at first, it's never nice when this happens to you.  I'm coming round now though and now starting to look forward to a change of direction.  I was with Flare/Civica 8 years and starting to feel quite institutionalised!     Linked in has been pretty good though, even though I have hardly anything on it, I've had all sorts of random contacts, although not what I'm looking for yet, but it makes me feel quite hopeful!  I even got a headhunting call from  Google!  But it was a permanent job and in London.  Even so, it was a nice feeling.    How are you doing?  Have you found anything you're interested in yet?    I'm looking at various options at the moment, and will probably go into consultancy in the short term.  Mainly because I want to spend January to March 2012 getting my next level snowboard instructor certificate in Bulgaria!.  So at the moment I just need to find something short term up until Christmas!      Have thought about it and I definitely don't want another permanent job just now, I want to try and do something entrepreneurial, and have a few ideas to explore.  But IT contracting is a fallback.    My personal email is helen_l_abell@yahoo.co.uk.  It would be good to keep in touch.    Best of luck with the job hunting!    Kind Regards  Helen    ",INBOX
